This project focuses on training deep learning models for two tasks:

1. Machine Translation – Implemented using RNN (from scratch), Transformers (from scratch), and T5 (fine-tuned from a pretrained model).

2. QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference) – Developed with RNN (from scratch), Transformers (from scratch), and DistilBERT (fine-tuned from a pretrained model).
